In this activity I created a database using MYSQL and a node application that will ineract with the database. It will allow the customer to select a product from the database and purchase it. The application then will inform the customer how much the order is and will deduct the quantity of the item from the database. 

Before you can use the application, you will need to install mysql, inquirer, cli-table using a terminal. You would also need a mysql database that is connected to port 3306 and enter a password if there is one.
